    "# Notebook 05 – Interactive Inference and CLI Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the trained baseline model for real-time incident classification through an interactive command-line interface. The goal is to provide a simple, operational prototype that security analysts could use to quickly triage incoming incidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose and Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "The interactive triage session simulates how the model would be deployed in a production SOC environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow:**\n",
    "1. Analyst receives an incident description (from user report, SIEM alert, or ticket)\n",
    "2. Analyst enters the description into the CLI tool\n",
    "3. Model returns predicted event type with confidence scores\n",
    "4. Analyst reviews probabilities to assess classification certainty\n",
    "5. High-confidence predictions can be auto-triaged; low-confidence cases require manual review\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Real-time prediction**: Instant classification of free-text descriptions\n",
    "- **Probability scores**: Shows confidence across all event types (top 5 displayed)\n",
    "- **Interactive loop**: Continuous session for testing multiple scenarios\n",
    "- **Text preprocessing**: Automatically applies the same cleaning pipeline used during training\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Use Cases:**\n",
    "- Testing how the model handles edge cases or ambiguous descriptions\n",
    "- Validating model behavior on real incident narratives from your environment\n",
    "- Prototyping integration with ticketing systems or SIEM platforms\n",
    "- Training new analysts on incident classification patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as a foundation for building production-ready inference APIs, web dashboards, or automated triage workflows."
